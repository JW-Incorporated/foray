/* Guard on the guards.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * `test/`, `player/` and `tools/` are in the auto-merge allowlist
 * (.github/workflows/automerge-nightly.yml), so an agent-authored PR touching
 * them can land with no human read. That creates one specific hole the path
 * allowlist cannot close by itself: a PR that DELETES or GUTS a test suite
 * still passes CI, because a suite with nothing in it passes trivially. The
 * attack (or, far more likely, the accident) is two steps — weaken the gate in
 * PR 1, land the thing it would have caught in PR 2 — and nothing between those
 * two steps involves a human.
 *
 * So: every suite carries a committed floor. Removing tests fails the build.
 *
 * ADDING tests is always fine and never requires touching this file. Raising a
 * floor is encouraged when a suite grows meaningfully. LOWERING one is the
 * deliberate act this file exists to make visible — do it in a PR that says why,
 * and note that this file is itself allowlisted, so the honest protection here
 * is that gutting the gate now requires editing two files instead of one, in a
 * diff that the weekly merge audit surfaces.
 *
 * This is a floor, not a coverage metric. It cannot tell a real test from
 * `test("x", () => {})`. It only makes deletion loud.
 *
 * WHY `tools/` IS SCANNED, AND SCANNED RECURSIVELY (issue #137)
 * This file shipped covering only `player/` and `test/`, which left the exact
 * hole it was written to close: `tools/` is Tier 3 of the same allowlist, and
 * `tools/refresh/*.test.mjs` had no floor and was not discovered either. A bot
 * PR could have gutted the refresh-pipeline tests, passed CI and auto-merged.
 *
 * The scan is recursive rather than a flat readdir of three directories
 * because `tools/` is a tree, not a folder: work lands in `tools/refresh/`,
 * `tools/segments/`, `tools/transcribe/` and whatever comes next. A flat scan
 * would have to be edited every time a subdirectory appeared, which is the
 * same "someone has to remember" failure that produced this issue. Recursing
 * means the NEXT suite is caught the day it lands, by a check nobody had to
 * update.
 *
 * A scanned directory that does not exist yet is not a failure — see
 * findSuites(). Several `tools/` subtrees are being created right now, and a
 * check that hard-failed on their absence would be red for reasons unrelated
 * to test integrity. The failing direction that matters is the other one: a
 * suite that EXISTS on disk with no committed floor.
