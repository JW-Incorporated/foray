# HUMAN-ACTIONS.md — anything only a founder can do

The one place owner actions live (PR #171). If a session finds something that
needs Joey's or Wyatt's identity, login, payment method, approval, or a click in
a UI an agent cannot reach, it goes here the moment it is identified — never in
a chat message, never in a variant filename.

**How to use it.** Each item has a `**Status:** OPEN` line. Change that one word
to `DONE`, `SKIP` (add a few words why) or `BLOCKED` (tried, something stopped
you). Do not cut, paste or move the block — the next session that opens this
file files it for you, keeping its number. Item numbers are stable IDs: never
reused, never renumbered, so "#1" means the same thing forever, including after
it is filed under `DONE`.

## OPEN

### 1. Decide whether `path-policy` should block, and make it required

**Tag:** `[UPGRADE]` · **Time:** ~3 minutes · **Owner:** Wyatt

**Why it matters.** The allow/deny path list used to live inside the auto-merge
workflow, so it governed only what GitHub Actions did. On 2026-08-16 two PRs
were merged from a laptop with `gh pr merge` and a founder token and went
straight past it — not by defeating the deny-list, but because on that route
there was nothing to defeat. The policy is now one tested module
(`tools/ci/path-policy.mjs`) reported as a status check named `path-policy` on
every PR. Today it is **report-only**: it says loudly in the PR's checks when a
PR touches a governed path (`.github/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/roles.md`,
`backend/src/`, `tools/ci/`) without a founder's `founder-approved` label, but it
stays green. These two steps make it actually block.

**Read this before doing it — it is a real trade, not a formality.**

- What you gain: both merge routes answer to the same rule, and every PR that
  touches a governed path says so on its own face instead of only in a workflow
  log nobody opens.
- What you do **not** gain, stated plainly because an earlier draft of this
  entry got it wrong: applying `founder-approved` makes the *check* green, it
  does **not** auto-merge the PR. You still click merge. Letting a label
  auto-merge a change to `.github/` or `CLAUDE.md` would be more dangerous than
  requiring the click, and nobody has decided that — if you want that trade,
  say so and it can be built, but it should not arrive as a side effect.
- What you do NOT gain: this is not a lock. You both have admin, and an admin
  can override a required check — that is supported and sometimes correct.
  Bluntly: the check is satisfied by a label, and an agent with write access to
  this repo can apply a label. So it is a guardrail against accidents and a
  record of intent, not a wall against a determined agent.
- The recommendation from the session that built it: **do it.** The honest
  version of this check, used consistently, is worth more than an absolute block
  nobody can operate. If you later want a signal an agent genuinely cannot
  produce, the next step is CODEOWNERS review from a founders-only team — a
  bigger change, and worth its own decision.

**Step 1 is already done.** `PATH_POLICY_ENFORCE=1` was set on 2026-08-16, so the
check now fails loudly on a governed path. Only step 2 — making it *required* —
is outstanding, and it is deliberately parked. Read the prerequisite first.

**Steps.**

1. ~~Turn on enforcement~~ — **done 2026-08-16.** For reference:

   ```
   gh variable set PATH_POLICY_ENFORCE --repo JW-Incorporated/foray --body 1
   ```

   To turn it back off at any time: `gh variable delete PATH_POLICY_ENFORCE --repo JW-Incorporated/foray`

2. Add `path-policy` to the required checks on `main`. Click path:
   **github.com/JW-Incorporated/foray** → **Settings** → **Rules** → **Rulesets**
   → **protect-main** → **Require status checks to pass** → **Add checks** →
   type `path-policy` → select it → **Save changes**.

   The existing required checks are `backend` and `data-and-site`; leave both.
   Leave **Require branches to be up to date before merging** OFF — it is off
   today, and turning it on would re-block PRs every time `main` moves.

**Worked if:** open any PR that edits a file under `.github/`. Its checks list
shows `path-policy` **failing** with "GOVERNED PATHS — NOT APPROVED (blocking)",
and the merge button is disabled. Add the `founder-approved` label to that PR;
within about a minute `path-policy` re-runs by itself (no push needed) and goes
green.

**Status:** OPEN

### 2. Listen to Foray #1 end to end, then decide whether to publish it

**Tag:** `[BLOCKING]` · **Time:** ~65 minutes of listening + 1 minute of edit · **Owner:** Joey

**Why it matters.** Foray #1 — the 61-minute history of grilling — is now real
data (`data/forays.json`, issue #182), and every number about it is a property
of timestamps and transcripts. **Nobody has heard it.** It is committed as
`"status": "draft"`, which by the same rule that governs ladders means no client
may ever surface it. Only a founder flips that. `docs/curation/segment-length-rules.md`
§10 is explicit that the listening is the experiment that should move the
pacing numbers, and §9 of `docs/curation/grilling-foray.md` says the first
person to listen will find things no rule caught.

Two known defects to listen for specifically, both recorded in
`docs/curation/grilling-foray.md` §4:

- **TAV-3** and **MOSS-4** open mid-clause — a listener hears a fragment for the
  first second or two.
- **TAV-2** opens *"Mrs Glass is famous for one other thing"* and the actual
  claim arrives about 4 s in, at the edge of what the rules allow.

There are **no narration bridges yet**, so nothing explains who is speaking or
why the subject moved. Expect that; it is the next workstream, not a defect in
this one. What each of the 31 transitions now has instead is **2.0 s of
silence** — the audiobook section-break beat, added because an instant cut from
one room to another reads as a glitch rather than as an edit. Judge that beat
while you listen: 2.0 s is a convention, not a measurement, and yours is the
first pair of ears on it. If it feels long, or too short, say so — it is one
number (`SEAM_GAP_SEC` in `player/seam-gap.js`) and item #3 below is the
decision that owns it.

**Steps.**

1. Read the running order: `docs/curation/grilling-foray.md` §2 (32 rows, in
   listening order, with what each one contributes).
2. Listen. **There is a player now** — #111 / #128 / #133 landed, so this is no
   longer a manual pass with a podcast app and a list of timestamps. Open:

   ```
   https://jw-incorporated.github.io/foray/?foray=grilling-history-1
   ```

   That link is the keyless way into the draft: it unlocks this one Foray for
   that one page load, is not persisted, and does not publish anything. Press
   **Play** and it runs all 32 segments in order, each starting and stopping at
   its own timestamp, with the 2.0 s beat between them. The strip along the top
   is a scrubber — click anywhere in it to jump to that point in the hour — and
   it remembers where you stopped, so this does not have to be one sitting.

   (The fallback still works if the page will not load: every source episode's
   audio URL is in `data/segment-sources.json` (`sources[].audio_url`) and each
   segment's in and out points are `start_sec` / `end_sec` in
   `data/segments.json`.)
3. Decide. If it holds together, change **one word** in `data/forays.json`:

   ```
   "status": "draft"     ->     "status": "published"
   ```

   in the `"grilling-history-1"` block, and open a PR with it. If it does not,
   say what was wrong and leave it `draft` — a note in the PR or the issue is
   enough; a session will re-cut it.

**Worked if:** either `data/forays.json` says `"status": "published"` on
`grilling-history-1`, or there is a written note saying what a listener heard
that the rules did not catch.

**Status:** OPEN

### 3. Reconcile the two silence numbers: 0.5 s in the brief, 2.0 s in the rules

**Tag:** `[UPGRADE]` · **Time:** ~5 minutes, after item #2

**Why it matters.** Two committed documents give different numbers for the
silence at a seam, and as of this change the player implements one of them, so
the other is now wrong in a way a reader cannot detect:

- `docs/brief/04_VOICE_AUDIO_SPEC.md`, line 12: *"Transitions: hard cuts are
  fine; add ~0.5 s of silence padding around TTS items."*
- `docs/curation/segment-length-rules.md` §6b: *"Silence. **≥ 2.0 s** of
  padding, against the ~0.5 s standard from `04_VOICE_AUDIO_SPEC.md`."*

The rules doc already argues the divergence is deliberate — 0.5 s is right for
*joining* audio around a narration line, 2.0 s is what it takes to *mark an
edit* (§2e, the audiobook section-break convention) — and its own §10 lists the
reconciliation as undecided, *"a spec change [that] needs Wyatt, since it
touches the player."* It now touches the player: `player/seam-gap.js` ships
2.0 s at every unbridged segment-to-segment seam. Nothing about the 0.5 s TTS
padding changed, because no narration exists to pad.

Left alone, the next person to implement bridges reads the brief, uses 0.5 s,
and two parts of the same transition disagree by 4x.

**Steps.**

1. Listen first (item #2). This is a judgement about a sound.
2. Pick one of three:
   - **Keep both, and say so.** Add one line to
     `docs/brief/04_VOICE_AUDIO_SPEC.md` line 12: the 0.5 s is padding around a
     TTS item; an unbridged seam is 2.0 s per `segment-length-rules.md` §6b.
     This is the recommendation — the two numbers do different jobs, and it is
     the only one of the three that touches no code.
   - **Move the number**, or **drop the beat** (which is the same edit with a
     zero). Just say what it should be — you do not have to make the change.
     For whoever does: it is `SEAM_GAP_SEC` in `player/seam-gap.js`, and
     changing it means updating the tests that pin the current value, which
     is deliberate rather than friction — the number is meant to be hard to
     move by accident. They are `player/seam-gap.test.js` ("the merged rule is
     2.0 s…", "an unbridged segment-to-segment auto-advance…"),
     `player/queue-manager.test.js` ("an unbridged segment-to-segment seam
     holds 2.0 s…", "the beat is observable in telemetry…") and
     `player/foray-playback.test.js` ("every one of Foray #1's 31 seams…").
     The `seamGapSec: 0` *constructor option* is already covered by a test and
     needs nothing changed to use — that is the quick way to A/B it by ear
     before committing to a number.
3. Whichever you pick, delete the "does not decide" bullet in
   `docs/curation/segment-length-rules.md` §10 that names this divergence.

**Worked if:** `04_VOICE_AUDIO_SPEC.md` and `segment-length-rules.md` can both
be read start to finish without coming away with two different answers to "how
much silence goes at a seam".

**Status:** OPEN

### Waiting on a founder (auto-maintained)

Generated by `node tools/ci/pr-triage.mjs waiting --write`, and re-rendered
into the run summary of `.github/workflows/pr-hygiene.yml` on every sweep.
Live, always-current view: <https://github.com/JW-Incorporated/foray/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Aneeds-founder>

Everything the merge machinery could not land on its own ends up here, so
the residue is one batched glance instead of something anyone has to notice.

**Nothing is waiting on a founder right now.**

<!-- END generated:waiting-on-you -->

Two notes on the block above, both worth knowing:

- **It is generated. Do not hand-edit between the markers** — the next run
  replaces everything in there. Anything you want to keep goes outside them.
- **It is refreshed on demand, not on a timer.** The scheduled sweep cannot
  commit it: `main` is protected with zero bypass, and a PR opened by the
  Actions token triggers no workflows, so its required checks would never run
  and it could never merge. A personal access token would fix that and break
  "this repo's cloud automation is deliberately keyless" (CLAUDE.md
  decision-authority item 2), which is not a trade worth making for a list. So
  the always-current view is the link above and the `pr-hygiene` run summary;
  any session brings the committed copy up to date with one idempotent command:

  ```
  node tools/ci/pr-triage.mjs waiting --write
  ```
