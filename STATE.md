# STATE.md — active workstream announcements

New file (2026-08-12). Cross-session coordination board: any session running in
this repo announces long-running workstreams here so other sessions can route
around them on their next recon pass. Keep entries short; full plans live in
docs/. Completed workstreams move to their plan doc's retro section.

## Active workstreams

### corpus — research corpus ingestion (Joey's Claude, started 2026-08-12)

- **What:** scrape + archive every source in `docs/research/foray-research-dossier.md`
  (~57 sources, 9 areas) into a migration-managed SQLite corpus with FTS5
  search, for later agent context / retrieval experiments / embedding backfill.
- **Branch prefix:** `corpus/*` — never commits to main directly, PRs only.
- **Owned directories:** `tools/corpus/` (new), `docs/research/corpus/` (new).
  DB + raw archives live in `data-local/corpus/` (already gitignored — nothing
  fetched is committed).
- **Shared files it will touch, each as its own isolated commit:**
  `test/suite-integrity.test.js` (mandatory floors for new tools/ suites),
  `docs/DECISIONS.md` (schema decision entry per workflow rule 4).
  Everything else stays inside owned directories.
- **Explicitly out of scope:** `data/*.json`, `tools/segments/`,
  `tools/transcribe/`, `tools/refresh/`, `backend/`, `app.js`, `.github/`
  (a ci.yml test step will be proposed as a separate PR left for Wyatt).
- **Plan:** `docs/research/corpus/PLAN.md`.
